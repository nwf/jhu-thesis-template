\todoin{write abstract}

Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now.
Look up here, man, I'm in danger.
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high it makes my brain whirl.
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I'd used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
This way or no way
You know, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird.
Now, ain't that just like me?
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird.
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?

I learned enough saxophone and guitar and what's euphemistically called \enquote{composer's piano} to get my ideas over to proper musicians. And then I went on a crusade, I suppose, to change the kind of information that rock music contained I adored. These included John Coltrane, Harry Partch, Eric Dolphy, Velvet Underground, John Cage, Sonny Smith, Anthony Newely, Florence Foster Jenkins, Johnnie Ray, Julie London, the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Edith Piaf and Shirley Bassey.
